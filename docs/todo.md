# Todo

- Hashes are wrongly calculated on big-endian machines. This just needs fixing of some #define's in the multihash library.
- Add MacOS X-specific code. All that is needed is a way to send MMC commands to the DVD-ROM drive. Inspiration can be taken from the libcdio sources. If only I had a Mac... Same goes for *BSD, anyway.
- Maybe write a graphical client. I will not do this as I am no GUI fanatic, but I am sure many Windows users will still use RawDump as it has a GUI, while we do not. This is actually quite easy, as the program is split into a library (libfriidump) and a frontend. If anybody does it, please try to make a portable GUI, maybe by using GTK+, qt, wxWidgets or whatever similar toolkit you might find.
- Make FriiDump as fast as RawDump (i.e.: 2.5 hours for a Wii disc).
- Improve and better document the library API.
