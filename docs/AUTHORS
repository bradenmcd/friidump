FriiDump came to existance thanks to the work by a lot of people, most of which
are probably not aware of this fact ;). So here is proper credit:

The DVD seed bruteforcing algorithm and code were taken from unscrambler 0.4
by Victor Muñoz (xt5@ingenieria-inversa.cl,
http://www.ingenieria-inversa.cl/?lp_lang_pref=en).

The theoritical basis of the dumping methods were suggested in several comments
to Victor's post. The most important comments came from Victor himself (xt5),
FuzzyLogic and svpe.

The code to actually perform the dumping was derived from the work of Kevin
East, AKA SeventhSon (kev@kev.nu, http://www.kev.nu/360/), which, in turn,
derives from work by a lot of other people. See his page for full details.

Many hints were taken from RawDump, whose author is unknown.

A program that helped me a lot to understand the drive cache behaviour is
PLScsi by Pat LaVarre (http://members.aol.com/plscsi/).

Nintendo disc structure information was taken from:
- http://www.gc-linux.org/docs/yagcd.html
- http://www.wiili.org/index.php/GameCube_Optical_Disc

Code to tell whether a Wii disc contains an update or was inspired by a program
by wiidevel@stacktic.org. Sorry but I cannot find the URL anymore :(.

Other minor pieces of code were taken from tcpdump (www.tcpdump.org), Python
(www.python.org) and the glibc printf manpage.

GDR8163B and Windows testing was performed by tasso85.

Thanks also go out to the ConsoleTribe staff for giving me the possibility to
use their forum for the program support.

Glue, endless hours spent understanding drive cache behaviour and rest of the
code are by me, Arep <arep@no.net>.

Finally, obvious thanks go out to Nintendo for making all of their great
consoles, who constantly help me to waste the rest of my spare time I do not
spend coding ;).
